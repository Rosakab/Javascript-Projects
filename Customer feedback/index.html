              Lavinia "Vinnie" Dickinson was instrumental in achieving the posthumous 
              publication of her sister's poems after having discovered the forty-odd manuscripts 
              in which Emily had collected her work. Despite promising her sister that she would destroy all 
              correspondence and personal papers, Vinnie sought to have her sister's poetry edited and published by two 
              of Emily's personal correspondents, Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd. Four years after 
              Emily Dickinson's death, in 1890, Poems was published by Roberts Brothers, Boston.

              Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was an American poet. Little-known during her life, 
              she has since been regarded as one of the most important figures in American poetry. Dickinson was born in Amherst,
               Massachusetts, into a prominent family with strong ties to its community.
